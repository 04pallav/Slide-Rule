Bare Bones: Write-up in the pdf, code in the ipython notebook.

Details:

My Data Story 1 is about finding good value in American universities. My dataset was the college scorecard, found at https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/. I investigated what schools are good and bad investments, comparing cost, salaries after graduation, access to financial aid, and debt at graduation. The data set was too large to upload to Github, but it can be found at https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/. The pdf is the most readable version of the write-up. The code for generating the charts and tables can be found in the ipython notebook, but it won't run very well without being connected to the dataset. .csv and .png files are graphics and tables created for the write-up. I wrote in apple pages, which is why that funky file extension shows up. Pages' .docx exporting is terrible.
